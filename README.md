"Customer Churn Prediction Model"

For subscription-based services, predicting customer churn—the likelihood that a customer will cancel their subscription—is vital. By identifying at-risk customers, businesses can take proactive measures to retain them. This project aims to develop a machine-learning model to predict customer churn using historical customer data, including usage behaviour and demographics.
